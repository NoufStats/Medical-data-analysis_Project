# Medical-data-analysis_Project
This is a personal data analysis project focused on heart attack cases in a hospital in Iraq. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and used to practice and showcase statistical analysis skills. The entire workflow—from data preparation to visualization—was completed independently as part of my personal development in healthcare analytics.

## 🎯 Project Objective
